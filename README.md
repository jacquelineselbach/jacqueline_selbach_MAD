Ask the user to guess the 4-digit number. The output should be in the format "n:m", where "n" is the number of digits guessed correctly,
regardless of their position, and "m" is the number of digits guessed correctly at their correct position. 

Here are some examples:

Generated number: 8576

•	User input: 1234, Output: 0:0
•	User input: 5678, Output: 4:1
•	User input: 5555, Output: 1:1
•	User input: 3586, Output: 3:2

Once the user guesses the correct number, the game is over.
